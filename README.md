- Motivation was to create a easy website that any user can use for helpful tips in regards to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
- I built this project as a helpful guide and to remind me of what I have learned in my bootcamp.
- It keeps all my class and homework notes in one place.
- I learned how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I have also learned that I look forward to this new journey.
